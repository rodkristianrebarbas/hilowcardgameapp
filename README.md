//My first attempt in making HI/LOW Card Game application using Flutter

//I create web and mobile versions of it using Layout Builder and Orientation Builder

//For mobile version, I used Pixel 2 API 25 emulator to execute the app and debugging it

//It has four orientation...we have mobile landscape/portrait and web portrait/landscape

//Resizing the web browser causes the game to automatically reset

//Turning the phone in landscape/portrait causes the game to reset too

Feel free to download the source code and study it....enjoy:)
